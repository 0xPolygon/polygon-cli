## Description

create a proof that's filled with zeros

```bash
polycli ulxly zero-proof [flags]
```

## Usage

Use this command to print a proof response that's filled with the zero
hashes. This values are very helpful for debugging because it would
tell you how populated the tree is and roughly which leaves and
siblings are empty. It's also helpful for sanity checking a proof
response to understand if the hashed value is part of the zero hashes
or if it's actually an intermediate hash.
## Flags

```bash
  -h, --help   help for zero-proof
```

The command also inherits flags from parent commands.

```bash
      --config string      config file (default is $HOME/.polygon-cli.yaml)
      --pretty-logs        output logs in pretty format instead of JSON (default true)
  -v, --verbosity string   log level (string or int):
                             0   - silent
                             100 - panic
                             200 - fatal
                             300 - error
                             400 - warn
                             500 - info (default)
                             600 - debug
