## Description

print a proof structure with the zero hashes

```bash
polycli ulxly zero-proof [flags]
```

## Usage

Use this command to print a proof response that's filled with the zero
hashes. This values are very helpful for debugging because it would
tell you how populated the tree is and roughly which leaves and
siblings are empty. It's also helpful for sanity checking a proof
response to understand if the hashed value is part of the zero hashes
or if it's actually an intermediate hash.
## Flags

```bash
  -h, --help   help for zero-proof
```

The command also inherits flags from parent commands.

      --pretty-logs     Should logs be in pretty format or JSON (default true)
