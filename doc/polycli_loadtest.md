## Description

Run a generic load test against an Eth/EVM style JSON-RPC endpoint.

```bash
polycli loadtest [flags]
```

## Usage

The `loadtest` tool is meant to generate various types of load against RPC end points. It leverages the [`ethclient`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient) library Go Ethereum to interact with the blockchain.x

```bash
$ polycli wallet inspect  --mnemonic "code code code code code code code code code code code quality" --addresses 1
```

The `--mode` flag is important for this command.

- `t`/`transaction` will perform ETH transfers. This is the simplest
  and cheapest transaction that can be performed.
- `d`/`deploy` will deploy the load testing contract over and over
  again.
- `c`/`call` will call random opcodes in our load test contract. The
  random function that is called will be repeatedly called in a loop
  based on the number of iterations from the `iterations` flag
- `f`/`function` works the same way as `call` mode but instead of
  calling random op codes, the opcode can be specified with the `-f`
  flag. If you want to call `LOG4` you would pass `-f 164` which is
  the opcode for `LOG4`.
- `2`/`erc20` will run an ERC20 transfer test. The process initializes
  by minting a large amount of tokens then transferring it in small
  amounts. Each transaction is a single transfer.
- `7`/`erc721` will run an ERC721 mint test which will mint an NFT
  over and over again. The `iterations` flag here can be used to
  control if we are mint 1 NFT or many.
- `i`/`inc`/`increment` will call the increment function repeatedly on
  the load test contract. It's a minimal example of a contract call
  that will require an update to a contract's storage.
- `s`/`store` is used to store random data in the smart contract
  storage. The amount of data stored per transaction is controlled
  with the `byte-count` flag.
- `P`/`precompiles` will randomly call the commonly implemented
  precompiled functions. This functions the same way as `call` mode
  except it's hitting precompiles rather than opcodes.
- `p`/`precompile` will call a specific precompile in a loop. This
  works the same way as `function` mode except rather than specifying
  an opcode, you're specifying a precompile. E.g to call `ECRECOVER`
  you would pass `-f 1` because it's the contract at address `0x01`
- `R`/`recall` will attempt to replay all of the transactions from the
  previous blocks. You can use `--recall-blocks` to specify how many
  previous blocks should be used to seed transaction history. It's
  expected that many of the transactions in this mode would fail.
- `r`/`random` will call any of the other modes randomly. This mode
  shouldn't be used in combination with other modes. Ideally this is a
  good way to generate a lot of random activity on a test network.
- `rpc` is a unique mode that won't just simulate transactions, it
  will simulate RPC traffic (e.g. calls to get transaction receipt or
  filter logs). This is meant to stress test RPC servers rather than
  full blockchain networks. The approach is similar to `recall` mode
  where we'll fetch some recent blocks and then use that data to
  generate a variety of calls to the RPC server.

The default private key is: `42b6e34dc21598a807dc19d7784c71b2a7a01f6480dc6f58258f78e539f1a1fa`. We can use `wallet inspect` to get more information about this address, in particular its `ETHAddress` if you want to check balance or pre-mine value for this particular account.

Here is a simple example that runs 1000 requests at a max rate of 1 request per second against the http rpc endpoint on localhost. It's running in transaction mode so it will perform simple transactions send to the default address.

```bash
$ polycli loadtest --verbosity 700 --chain-id 1256 --concurrency 1 --requests 1000 --rate-limit 1 --mode t --rpc-url http://localhost:8888
```

Another example, a bit slower, and that specifically calls the [LOG4](https://www.evm.codes/#a4) function in the load test contract in a loop for 25,078 iterations. That number was picked specifically to require almost all of the gas for a single transaction.

```bash
$ polycli loadtest --verbosity 700 --chain-id 1256 --concurrency 1 --requests 50 --rate-limit 0.5  --mode f --function 164 --iterations 25078 --rpc-url http://private.validator-001.devnet02.pos-v3.polygon.private:8545
```

### Load Test Contract

The codebase has a contract that used for load testing. It's written in Solidity. The workflow for modifying this contract is.

1. Make changes to <file:contracts/LoadTester.sol>
2. Compile the contracts:
   - `$ solc LoadTester.sol --bin --abi -o . --overwrite`
3. Run `abigen`
   - `$ abigen --abi LoadTester.abi --pkg contracts --type LoadTester --bin LoadTester.bin --out loadtester.go`
4. Run the loadtester to enure it deploys and runs successfully
   - `$ polycli loadtest --verbosity 700 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8541`

## Flags

```bash
      --adaptive-backoff-factor float          When using adaptive rate limiting, this flag controls our multiplicative decrease value. (default 2)
      --adaptive-cycle-duration-seconds uint   When using adaptive rate limiting, this flag controls how often we check the queue size and adjust the rates (default 10)
      --adaptive-rate-limit                    Enable AIMD-style congestion control to automatically adjust request rate
      --adaptive-rate-limit-increment uint     When using adaptive rate limiting, this flag controls the size of the additive increases. (default 50)
      --batch-size uint                        Number of batches to perform at a time for receipt fetching. Default is 999 requests at a time. (default 999)
  -b, --byte-count uint                        If we're in store mode, this controls how many bytes we'll try to store in our contract (default 1024)
      --call-only                              When using this mode, rather than sending a transaction, we'll just call. This mode is incompatible with adaptive rate limiting, summarization, and a few other features.
      --call-only-latest                       When using call only mode with recall, should we execute on the latest block or on the original block
      --calldata string                        The hex encoded calldata passed in. The format is function signature + arguments encoded together. This must be paired up with --mode contract-call and --contract-address
      --chain-id uint                          The chain id for the transactions.
  -c, --concurrency int                        Number of requests to perform concurrently. Default is one request at a time. (default 1)
      --contract-address string                The address of the contract that will be used in --mode contract-call. This must be paired up with --mode contract-call and --calldata
      --contract-call-payable                  Use this flag if the function is payable, the value amount passed will be from --eth-amount. This must be paired up with --mode contract-call and --contract-address
      --erc20-address string                   The address of a pre-deployed ERC20 contract
      --erc721-address string                  The address of a pre-deployed ERC721 contract
      --eth-amount float                       The amount of ether to send on every transaction (default 0.001)
      --force-contract-deploy                  Some load test modes don't require a contract deployment. Set this flag to true to force contract deployments. This will still respect the --lt-address flags.
  -f, --function uint                          A specific function to be called if running with --mode f or a specific precompiled contract when running with --mode a (default 1)
      --function-arg strings                   The arguments that will be passed to a contract function call. This must be paired up with "--mode contract-call" and "--contract-address". Args can be passed multiple times: "--function-arg 'test' --function-arg 999" or comma separated values "--function-arg "test",9". The ordering of the arguments must match the ordering of the function parameters.
      --function-signature string              The contract's function signature that will be called. The format is '<function name>(<types...>)'. This must be paired up with '--mode contract-call' and '--contract-address'. If the function requires parameters you can pass them with '--function-arg <value>'.
      --gas-limit uint                         In environments where the gas limit can't be computed on the fly, we can specify it manually. This can also be used to avoid eth_estimateGas
      --gas-price uint                         In environments where the gas price can't be determined automatically, we can specify it manually
  -h, --help                                   help for loadtest
      --inscription-content string             The inscription content that will be encoded as calldata. This must be paired up with --mode inscription (default "data:,{\"p\":\"erc-20\",\"op\":\"mint\",\"tick\":\"TEST\",\"amt\":\"1\"}")
  -i, --iterations uint                        If we're making contract calls, this controls how many times the contract will execute the instruction in a loop. If we are making ERC721 Mints, this indicates the minting batch size (default 1)
      --legacy                                 Send a legacy transaction instead of an EIP1559 transaction.
