This command is meant to allow for easy creation of signed transactions. A raw transaction can then be published with a call to
[`eth_sendRawTransaction`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_sendrawtransaction) or using [`cast publish`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-publish).
