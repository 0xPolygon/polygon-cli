This command will attempt to scan a range of blocks and look for uLxLy
Bridge Events. This is is the specific signature that we're interested
in:

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Emitted when bridge assets or messages to another network
     */
    event BridgeEvent(
        uint8 leafType,
        uint32 originNetwork,
        address originAddress,
        uint32 destinationNetwork,
        address destinationAddress,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes metadata,
        uint32 depositCount
    );

```

If you're looking at the raw topics from on chain or in an explorer, this is the associated value:

`0x501781209a1f8899323b96b4ef08b168df93e0a90c673d1e4cce39366cb62f9b`

Each event that we counter will be parsed and written as JSON to
stdout. Example usage:

```bash
polycli ulxly deposit-get \
        --bridge-address 0x528e26b25a34a4A5d0dbDa1d57D318153d2ED582 \
        --rpc-url https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/demo \
        --from-block 4880876 \
        --to-block 6028159 \
        --filter-size 9999 > cardona-4880876-to-6028159.ndjson
```

This command would look for bridge events from block `4880876` to
block `6028159` in increments of `9999` blocks at a time for the
contract address `0x528e26b25a34a4A5d0dbDa1d57D318153d2ED582`. The
output will be written as newline delimited JSON.

This command is very specific for the ulxly bridge and it's meant to
serve as the input to the proof command.
