This command will attempt to compute the root of the balnace tree based on the bridge
events that are provided.

Example usage:

```bash
polycli ulxly compute-balance-nullifier-tree \
        --l2-claim-file l2-claim-0-to-11454081.ndjson \
        --l2-deposits-file l2-deposits-0-to-11454081.ndjson \
        --l2-network-id 3 | jq '.'
```

In this case we are assuming we have two files
`l2-claim-0-to-11454081.ndjson` and `l2-deposits-0-to-11454081.ndjson` that would have been generated
with a call to `polycli ulxly get-deposits` and `polycli ulxly get-claims` pointing to each network.
The output will be the roots of the trees for the provided deposits and claims.

This is the response from polycli:

```json
{
  "balanceTreeRoot": "0x089ed8cce8639374a1bbd2480df7ed5224ea715b7521e1e2de549a6def791757",

}
