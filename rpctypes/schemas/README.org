The openrpc.json file comes from this repo:
https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis

In order to build it, we run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
npm install
npm run build
#+END_SRC

Rather than keeping a unique schema per method, we'll try to decompose
into unique schemas for simplicity.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cat openrpc.json | jq '.methods[].name' | sort
cat openrpc.json | jq '.methods[] | select(.name == "eth_syncing") | .result.schema'
#+END_SRC
