# Requirements

1. Make sure you have `solc@0.7.6` installed. This is required to build UniswapV3 contracts. A handy way to manage `solc` versions is to use [crytic/solc-select](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select).

2. Build the core, periphery and swap-router contracts using the `build.sh`script.

```sh
$ sh build.sh
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.7.6+commit.7338295f.Darwin.appleclang

3. Generate Go bindings for Uniswap contracts using the `bindings.sh` script.

```sh
$ sh bindings.sh
abigen version 1.13.1-stable
‚úÖ UniswapV3Factory bindings generated.
